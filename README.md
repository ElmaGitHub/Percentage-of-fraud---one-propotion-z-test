An insurance company is investigating fraud among claimants and wants to know if it is more than 16%.

Fawn is a private investigator. She has taken a job for an insurance company. The insurance company has been paying out large amounts of money for workman’s comp claims, and they believe some of those claims are fraudulent. The insurance company wants Fawn and her associates to run surveillance to determine if the rate of fraud is higher than what the industry normally reports. Specifically, they want to know if the incidence of fraud among claimants is more than 16%.
They provide Fawn with a random sample of 94 claimants who have been diagnosed as unable to perform any physical labor beyond light housekeeping activities. They have asked Fawn to observe the sample, and report back to them how many of the claimants are obviously doing things that are much more strenuous than light housekeeping, such as strenuous yard work, weightlifting at the gym or other strenuous sporting activities, etc.
Fawn and her team spend about 8 weeks completing their observations, and report back to the insurance company that 28 of the 94 claimants are not nearly as “disabled” as their diagnosis suggests. The insurance company wants to test the data.
